# Electron Tomography 
Code created during undergraduate internship under Moule Group (Renewable ENergy ELectronics Lab) at UC Davis
- Started Summer 2022
- for optimization of 3D Characterization of PbSe Quantum Dot Super Lattices

Part 1: 
  Translated MATLAB (Xiaolei Chu) to Python 
  Created functions for optimization of layerization
  K-Means CLustering, Histograms, Projection Vectors
  
Part 2:
  Working on manual segementation of mrc files
  Utilizing Napari

Plan: 
    Interpolate manual segemtation 
    Create array 
    Use generated array to retrain U-Net Model
